Looking for new friends? Then it's time to find your friends using our special app called "FrienFinder".

## Requirements

* Modularity in the form of separate files for server logic, storing of friends, views, and routing.
* 10-question survey.
* Use express and path npm packages in the server.js file.
* Separate JavaScript files for routing (htmlRoutes.js and apiRoutes.js).
* Separate file for storing friends (friends.js).
* Calculate best match for user once survey is completed and return that match to the user.


## Technologies Used

* HTML
- JS
* jQuery
* node.js
* Express.js
* Bootstrap
* CSS

## Code Explanation

User should take a survey to get the results.
This app basically calculates array of numbers to find the best match.
Freiends stored such as:
{
	name: "Ziad",
	photo: "https://media.giphy.com/media/ZYoFTHxrWNFbW/giphy.gif",
	scores: [5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 1]
}
then it will give user to the answer or selected info.

## In Addition

Also we've added button named "Home Page" to go back to the home route.
And some awsome styling to the background.

# Enjoy!
